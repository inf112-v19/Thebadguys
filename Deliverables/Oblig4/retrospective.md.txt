### Retrospective

We have decided that Wim will be taking over the test role. He will make sure that new
methods are tested adequately and follow up on tests added by the other team members.

As for experiences relating to project methology, we have been using branches more and
more as the project grows in scale, and this has lead to improvement in terms of
efficiency in some aspects and a lot of headaches in other. Technical issues have still
plagued many of the members, and we still need to make a habit of pulling more frequently
and make sure the respective branches stay up to date. On the last oblig we somehow had
a HelloWorld file in our sources folder which was a result of varying versions across the
branches. 

The group dynamics is still going strong in our group, although we plan on having the people
who have coded the least to code more in the future. This also means that the person who
has coded the most will take a different role going forward. Other than that people are
completing their given tasks in a timely fashion, and the workload overall is shared
proportionally.

The communication is also a strong asset in our team. We communicate over many different
platforms and we are quick to respond to communications from our teammembers.

Thinking back to what has we have done so far and what can be better, branches come to mind
immidiately. We had a whole two hour meeting dedicated to making sure everyones branches
worked with the current version of the game and fixing java version issues. This was an
avoidable problem that could have been avoided if we pulled regularly from eachothers
branches. We also need to stay on top of our list of priorites. We have been inconsistent
in implementing crucial elements of the requirements that have limited our developemnt. Currently
and in the future we will be working on implementing these elements into our game and 
emphesize the importance of our priority list. Our code also needs to cleaned up in some aspects. 
After implementing an aspect of the game we have often left that as a functioning mess in our 
RoboRallyDemo class. Not only is this class inappropriately named, but its filled with methods
that should be implemented in other classes for ease of implementation of other facets of
the game. 

We plan on working on cleaning up the code for the next sprint. We concluded that in order to keep
adding to the code in the current state will only make it harder in the future.
